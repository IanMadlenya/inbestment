Putting all of your money under the mattress is never a good choice. The goal of Inbestment is to help individuals easily come up with a financial plan and determine the amount and type of accounts they should fund first. Using the Intuit Customer Account Data API, users are able to import real banking account information to their profiles. Inbestment uses relational database modeling and large datasets to provide a recommended investment portfolio based on risk tolerance and graphically present performance over time. Users can also compare other stock's performance to their portfolio.
